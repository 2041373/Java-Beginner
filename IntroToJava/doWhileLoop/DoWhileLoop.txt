Do-While Loop:

It is the same as a While loop but it executes the code first and then checks the condition. It will execute code at least once if the condition is false.

Syntax:

do{

//statements to be repeated

}while(condition);


Example:

public class DoWhileExample {
public static void main(String[] args) {
   int i=1;
   do{
       System.out.println(i);
       i++;
       }while(i<=10);
     }
}    

Output:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
